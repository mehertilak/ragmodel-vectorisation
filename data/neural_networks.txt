Neural Networks: The Backbone of Deep Learning

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's biological neural networks. They form the foundation of deep learning, a subset of machine learning that has revolutionized artificial intelligence.

Key Components:
1. Neurons (Nodes)
- Basic computational units
- Receive, process, and transmit information
- Connected through weighted synapses

2. Layers
- Input Layer: Receives initial data
- Hidden Layers: Perform intermediate computations
- Output Layer: Produces final results

3. Training Neural Networks
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Gradient descent for weight optimization
- Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Game playing AI
- Autonomous driving
